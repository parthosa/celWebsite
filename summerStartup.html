          <h4>About This Project</h4>
          <p> The ‘Summer in a Start-up’ programme seeks to promote start-ups and encourage entrepreneurial acumen amongst undergraduates. An initiative of The Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership, BITS 

            Pilani and powered by BITSAA, SiS aims to give the students at BITS Pilani the opportunity to intern 

            at a start-up over the summer. In 2015, CEL is proud to present the 7th edition of SiS.

            <br><br>The end-to-end objective for SiS and CEL add symbiotic value, to the start-up and the intern. 

            Considering the constraints of capital and infrastructure that a start-up deals with, each team member 

            is looked upon as an invaluable asset, responsible for robust performance delivery in a start-up. In 

            plain words- the interns are virtual stakeholders of the start-up, thereby replicating the total 

            experience of operating in the start-up ambiance. Working in a company with an optimum head count 

            of less than 50, SiS interns have the opportunity to “be heard”, receive and share insight and bring 

            real action to the table.

            <br><br>Undergraduates, especially freshmen generally presume that their lack of technical skills will render 

            them ineligible for an internship. Though this holds for corporate firms and large industries, there 

            exists a plethora of start-ups for students to spend the summer constructively.  And those who do 

            manage to intern at large corporate houses are often disappointed at their skills not being leveraged 

            to the optimum; an inevitable consequence of interning at a firm with thousands of underutilized 

            talent. 

            <br><br>SiS’s track record so far reflects our success in meeting the objectives of the program- to provide 

            students the opportunity to understand entrepreneurship hands-on, and bring in new talent and fresh 

            perspective to start-ups, besides a long term relationship with an institute of BITS Pilani’s pedigree.</p>

            <h4>Testimonials</h4>
            <p>I was looking around for a short course/job/intern that I could do in the summers in order to spend my 

time productively, and it was then that I read about the CEL Summer in a Startup Program. There 

were quite a few options in the list, but because I’m an economics dualite, I chose to apply for the 

microfinance firm Eko India Ltd. The pay was decent (7k/month), the work seemed exciting, and the 

company was located in Delhi, which is my hometown.  So I sent in my CV and got shortlisted for the 

telephonic interview, which took place a couple of days later and consequently, I was selected.

We were interning in the Marketing division and were 

working directly under the Chief Marketing Officer. For 

the first week or so, we were given a general 

introduction to Eko, and the work that we were 

expected to do. Unlike what you would expect from a 

start-up, most of the people working there had 

bagloads of experience under their belts and had all 

quit their previous jobs because they really believed in 

what Eko was doing. This served as a huge 

motivational factor for us.

Our stay at Eko had been divided into two phases and 

we were supposed to finish one project in each of the 

phases. At the end of each project, we were to give a 

presentation detailing the work we’d done. We were told at the onset that the presentations would be 

attended by all the top people there, including the CEO, the COO and all the other permutations and 

combinations of C’s and O’s that you can think of, so slacking off was definitely not an option.

Our first project was the creation financial diaries of Eko’s customers, finding out their grievances with 

the service, and suggesting remedies for the same. This entailed going out, visiting the customers 

and Eko centres, interviewing the people in detail and then filling in our reports. Since the customer 

segment Eko targets belongs to the lower income bracket, our work had us going to the poorer parts 

of Delhi to spend time with the people there and understand their lives. It was quite an eye opener. 

The second project was about studying the youth as a segment that Eko could target in the future, 

which again meant interaction, understanding what the customers expected. After the completion of 

each phase, we were given a week to compile all our data, analyze it and then present it along with 

our recommendations to Eko. It was gratifying to see how well both our presentations were received. 

The farewell was pretty awesome too with the whole start-up bidding us adieu with cakes and gifts.

All in all, it was a great experience, and something that I would love to do again, if given the chance. 

Everyone at Eko was very supportive and encouraging; so much so that never for a moment did we 

feel that we did not belong there.  Personally, the stint there did wonders for my confidence, and for 

this, I can’t thank CEL enough. <br><strong>- Nishant  Suri (BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus)</strong></p><br><br><p>It was the during mid of my second semester when I decided to do something fruitful in the two and 

half month long summer break and started searching for some internship or project. It was then that I 

came across the Summer in a Start-Up program by Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership, BITS 

Pilani. I went through the profile of all the start-ups and found Grey Orange Robotics Pvt. Ltd. to be 

best suited to my interests. I sent my CV for the profile of Curriculum Design Engineer and was 

selected for the same after a personal interview with the Director of the company, Akash Gupta. 

 Although I had other internship options also available, but I decided to stick with GOR (as we call it). 

And now in hindsight I feel that it was a right choice that I made.

Working with GOR is a great experience (Yes, I am still working with them). It is a great feeling to 

work with a bunch of dedicated people who are always there to clear your doubts and motivating you 

and helping you in achieving your targets.

The first half of my internship was more of a learning experience. I worked on a number of platforms 

ranging from humanoid robots to line tracking bots, from school level robotics to college level robotics. 

I always found myself surrounded by a bunch of enthusiastic people, who guided me through my way 

and made me aware of the new stuff going out there.

The second half was aimed at applying my knowledge on to my projects. I developed a program for a 

humanoid hand working. I also developed the curriculum for school robotics program. In addition to 

this I also worked on the BIOLOID Humanoid KIT.

But my journey with GOR didn’t just end after summers. Thereafter I was a part of a number of 

workshops conducted by GOR. I am currently a part of school robotics program run by GOR. In 

addition to this the knowledge that I gained during my summer internship is helping me to build my 

own projects this APOGEE and also helping me to implement my new ideas.

All this has become true just because of GOR and CEL’s SIS program. I am thankful to both of them 

for helping me discover my passion and providing me an opportunity to work in my interest field. I 

hope that this time also students get to discover their passion and their interest through SIS.

“Best of Luck for your Summers”.<br><strong>- Kapil Vatwani (BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus)</strong></p>
